Since Security is an important thing, I've added some recomendation for you about security, too.
+ A great password is:
    + not an obvious one like [this](http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2013-god-help-us-1504852434)
    + long -> [xkcd.com/936/](http://xkcd.com/936/)
    + simple to remember.
    + something that nobody can guess it.
    + different than other important passwords --> some sites/forums force you to join for a little information! use same password for all of those sites. But use a STRONG password for your Banking Account and important files.
+ Make sure there is no software/hardware keylogger in/on your system.
+ Make sure you are connected to a [safe Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep). Read [this](http://readwrite.com/2010/10/25/at_a_cafe_i_can_hack_your_facebook_twitterwith_a_f), too.
+ Since handheld devices(Tablet, Smart Phones, etc.) show each character when you type a password and then make a `*`, be sure that nobody's watching you when you type your password.
